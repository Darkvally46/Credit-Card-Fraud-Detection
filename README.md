# Credit Card Fraud Detection 🕵️‍♀️💳

This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using supervised learning methods like Scikit-Learn and Snap ML (IBM's optimized ML library).

---

## 📊 Key Highlights:

- ✅ Dataset: Anonymized credit card transactions
- 🧠 Models Used: Linear SVM (Scikit-Learn & Snap ML), Decision Trees
- 🧪 ROC-AUC Score: **0.966** (both models)
- 📉 Hinge Loss:
  - Scikit-learn SVM: **0.234**
  - Snap ML SVM: **0.228**
- ⚡ Snap ML training was significantly faster than Scikit-learn!
